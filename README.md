# libscheisse

Because everything just plain sucks.

libscheisse is a single-purpose C++ library that puts emphasis in sentences using the word "Schei√üe".

It provides two functions to interact with the library's functionality:

- `analyse`: Iterates through input and provides an analysis about the German grammar rules
- `verscheissern`: Sprinkles emphasis on the input based on flags provided as a parameter

Usecases include:

- Tough times
- Breakups
- Loss of a loved one
- Reduction of medication doses
- Raise in medication doses
- New neighbors
- Destroyed furniture due to animal involvement
- Broken glass or porcelain
- Thinking too long about the Heat Death of the Universe
- Eating nothing for too long
- Stepping on Lego (TM)

## Details

libscheisse has specific goals in mind:

- Use recent C++ standards where applicable: Pave a way for the future
- Run on the Web using WebAssembly: The Web is hot new stuff, yo!
- Optimized for binary size reduction: It's intended to run on devices no matter the size constraints
- Allow for implementing Serious Business (TM) applications: Provide technology for *actual* Grammar detection (some day, when I feel like it)

## A note about its purpose

The purpose: Humor. Have you heard about it? I was sad before I came up with libscheisse, and now I don't feel sad.
It is clearly a piece of work for entertainment (at the moment). Don't even dare to sue me because you've sent a message to the wrong person insulting someone or taking life too serious.
