# libscheisse

Because everything just plain sucks.

libscheisse is a single-purpose C++ library that puts emphasis in sentences using the word "Schei√üe".

It provides two functions to interact with the library's functionality:

- `analyse`: Iterates through input and provides an analysis about the German grammar rules
- `verscheissern`: Sprinkles emphasis on the input based on flags provided as a parameter

Usecases include:

- Tough times
- Breakups
- Loss of a loved one
- Reduction of medication doses
- Raise in medication doses
- New neighbors
- Destroyed furniture due to animal involvement
- Broken glass or porcelain
- Thinking too long about the Heat Death of the Universe
- Eating nothing for too long
- Stepping on Lego (TM)

## A note about its purpose

The purpose: Humor. Have you heard about it? It is clearly a piece of work for entertainment (at the moment).
Don't even dare to sue me because you've sent a message to the wrong person insulting someone or taking life too serious.
